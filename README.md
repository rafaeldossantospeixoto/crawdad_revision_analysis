This repository contains code scripts to reproduce analyses and figures for the review process of our *bioRxiv* preprint [Peixoto R. dos S. et al. (2023), "Characterizing cell-type spatial relationships across length scales in spatially resolved omics data", *bioRxiv*](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.05.560733), which evaluates the utility of an R package CRAWDAD.

## CRAWDAD

`CRAWDAD` is a statistical framework that uses labeled spatial omics data to identify the colocalization or separation of cell types at different scales. CRAWDAD identifies regions where multiple cells colocalize, the scale of such colocalization, and also subsets the cell types based on their proximity to others. Therefore, CRAWDAD is a powerful tool for tissue characterization and comparison.
